Package: libelf++0
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: C++11 ELF parser
 Libelfin is a from-scratch C++11 library for reading ELF binaries and DWARFv4
 debug information.
 .
 Libelfin implements a syntactic layer for DWARF and ELF, but not a semantic
 layer. Interpreting the information stored in DWARF DIE trees still requires a
 great deal of understanding of DWARF, but libelfin will make sense of the bytes
 for you.
 .
 This package contains the library to parse ELF binaries.
